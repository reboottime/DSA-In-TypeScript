# Tree

## Tree Concepts

---

### Traversal:

- variants:
  - breadth first: queue
  - depth first: recursion
- order: preorder, in order, post order traversal

---

### Variants

- Binary search tree: All values on the left side are smaller than its ancestor nodes' values, and all values on the right side are bigger than its ancestor nodes' values
